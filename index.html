<h1 id="welcomeMessage">Welcome to the JavaScript Refresher page!</h1>

<p>Your tasks:
    <ul>
        <li>Connect the JavaScript file - you will see an alert</li>
        <li>Add a button - Make the alert only show up when you press the button</li>
        <button onclick="SendAlert()">ALERT!</button>
    </ul>
    Extension
    <ul>
        <li>Add a text input</li>
        <li>The button alerts you with the text you wrote</li>
        <li>Get rid of the alert - the button updates the heading of this page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You learned all this last year. You just need to remember how!<br>
    You can Google it, ask a friend, copy from last year's work, whatever works for you.<br>
    By the end of the spell you should have some JavaScript going.</p>

<h3>Don't you just love it when you remember nothing from last years work, if not less than even the year before that.</h3>
<p>I don't even so much as remember how to make a text box or button!</p>
